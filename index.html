  Hurricane Helene made landfall in Taylor County as a Category 4 storm, killing one<br>
  person near Tampa after a highway sign fell due to 140 mph winds. Gov. Ron DeSantis<br>
  warned Floridians of dangerous conditions, with widespread flooding expected and search<br>
  and rescue teams standing by for recovery efforts.

  Record Flooding Strikes Riverview as Hurricane Helene Causes Chaos
</h2>

<p class="second-article">
  Residents along the Alafia River were caught off guard by Hurricane <br>
  Helene&apos;s storm surge, which caused record flooding, with waters<br>
  reaching 9.4 feet. Angela Berdequez and Tony Maiorana had to<br>
  evacuate through waist-deep water, carrying their dog to safety,<br>
  while other locals abandoned their homes in search of higher<br>
  ground. Katherine Wiitanen and Scott Long sheltered on a neighbor&apos;s<br>
  porch after their home was submerged, while a downed power line<br>
  on U.S. 301 added to the dangers in Riverview. Some, like<br>
  Dante Watkins, found themselves stranded after floodwaters disabled<br>
  their vehicles. Many residents now face uncertainty as they await news<br>
  on the condition of their homes and belongings.

  injured and later died at a hospital. A woman inside the home was also injured<br>

<h2>Tampa City Council Approves Pay Raise Amid Divided Vote</h2>

<p class="second-article">
  Starting October 1, Tampa City Council members will receive a pay raise<br>
  following a split 4-3 vote. Council members Lynn Hurtak, Gwen Henderson,<br> 
  Alan Clendenin, and Guido Manscalco supported the raise, arguing it<br>
  aligns their compensation with other regional councils and could encourage<br>
  a broader group to run for office. Charlie Miranda, Luis Viera, and<br>
  Bill Carlson opposed the measure. <br>
  This comes two years after the council rejected a similar pay increase.<br>
